<p>Discovering which users have logged into Outlook Web App (OWA) compared to those who haven't is a bit of a challenge in Exchange Online and Exchange Server 2013/2016. One method is to make use of the fact that prior to first login, a user won't have selected their language. Using this piece of knowledge allows us to perform a (somewhat rudimentary) evaluation of which users <em>probably*</em> have logged into OWA.</p>
<h2>The easy way</h2>
<p>Connect to Exchange PowerShell and run the following:<br />
[ps]<br />
Get-Mailbox -ResultSize:unlimited | Get-MailboxRegionalConfiguration<br />
[/ps]</p>
<p>Easy! This will show you each mailbox and by evaluating the "Language" value for each, you can determine if a user's logged into OWA or not. Let's make it even easier:</p>
<h2>The really easy way</h2>
<p>[ps]<br />
# Show me all the mailboxes that have probably not logged into OWA<br />
Get-Mailbox -ResultSize:unlimited | Get-MailboxRegionalConfiguration | Where-Object {$null -eq $_.Language} </p>
<p># Tell me how many people have logged into OWA versus those who<br />
# haven't (Those with a language will have a value, blanks have not logged in)<br />
Get-Mailbox -ResultSize:unlimited | Get-MailboxRegionalConfiguration | Group-Object Language<br />
[/ps]</p>
<p>* You'll note several occurrences of "probably" in this post. This is because some lovely Exchange Server admins like to preset regional settings for users as part of user deployment. This is a wonderful idea, and I strongly encourage it. Unfortunately, however, it breaks everything discussed above.</p>
