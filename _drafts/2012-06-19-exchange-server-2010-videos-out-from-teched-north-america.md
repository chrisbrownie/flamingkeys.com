<a href="http://twitter.com/exchservpro" target="_blank">Paul Cunningham</a> over at <a href="http://ExchangeServerPro.com" target="_blank">ExchangeServerPro.com</a> has compiled a nice <a href="http://exchangeserverpro.com/teched-north-america-2012-exchange-2010" target="_blank">list of Exchange Server 2010 session videos</a> that have come out of <a href="http://northamerica.msteched.com/" target="_blank">TechEd North America</a> this year. If you have any more than a passing interest in Exchange Server, Iâ€™d suggest you head over to his site and check out the videos. Be sure to subscribe to his newsletter for some seriously great Exchange Server content.
