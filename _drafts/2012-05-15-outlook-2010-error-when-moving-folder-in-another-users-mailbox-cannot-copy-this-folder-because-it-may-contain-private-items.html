<p>This error occurs when you try to move a folder in another user’s mailbox that contains private items (duh!). Upon Googling (Binging) this you’ll see people sprouting about how this is a bug that’s been around forever, it’s something Microsoft should fix, yada yada yada. The fact of the matter is, private items are private for a reason, and by design. You can mark items private so that without your express consent, no other user – not even one with “Full Control” over your mailbox – can see them. Allowing users to see and move private items is a somewhat trivial exercise, but the solution is relatively evasive on the internet, so here goes:</p>
<p>Open Outlook as the user whose mailbox the private items are in. Click on File, Account Settings and then Delegate Access.</p>

<p>Click on Add, then find the account of the user who’s receiving the error. Complete the dialogue so the settings below are set (at minimum):</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flamingkeys.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/image1.png"><img style="display: inline" title="image" alt="image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/image_thumb1.png" width="354" height="298" /></a></p>
<p>Click OK, then OK again. It’s as easy as that! Restart Outlook and you will be able to move the folders and items.</p>

<p><font color="#ff0000"><strong>Note:</strong></font> When doing this, I received the following error:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flamingkeys.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/image2.png"><img style="display: inline" title="image" alt="image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/image_thumb2.png" width="345" height="134" /></a></p>
<p>This is an error that halts the saving of settings, so you need to tell Outlook to ignore this. A simple registry key will suffice:</p>
<p>HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Outlook\Preferences</p>
<p>Create a DWORD “IgnoreSOBError” with value “1”.</p>
<p>Restart Outlook and you’ll be able to perform the actions above without seeing this error.</p>
