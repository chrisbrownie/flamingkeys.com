<p>One of the people I was lucky enough to meet at Tech·Ed Australia 2011 was Mr Paul Cunningham, who runs the popular website <a href="http://www.exchangeserverpro.com/" target="_blank">Exchange Server Pro</a>. Paul is one of the most respected names going around when it comes to Exchange, and he has the real world experience to back it up. As a favour to the community (and our profession) Paul has decided to produce a free (as in free beer) boot camp for those wanting to learn Exchange 2010. The boot camp consists of four modules&#160; containing physical challenges, early morning runs, rope climbs*, text, screen shots and videos to help you learn the basics of Exchange Server 2010. Having worked through this boot camp myself, I can say that this is an invaluable resource for those getting started with Exchange Server, and also those who may have managed an Exchange environment but not installed one before.</p>
<p>Please make sure you check the boot camp out, and also be sure to stick Paul’s blog in your RSS reader, it’s an invaluable resource you’ve probably stumbled on a hundred times whilst Googling (Binging?) Exchange issues.</p>

<p>* May not contain any of these strenuous physical activities.</p>
