If you’re into PowerShell, you know the Scripting Games are coming up in April. This is a great opportunity for those of any skillset to dive into the technology and write some fun scripts, with the added bonus of them being reviewed by a PowerShell celebrity! Ed Wilson, Microsoft’s Scripting Guy, has released the <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/heyscriptingguy/archive/2012/02/05/2012-scripting-games-study-guide-a-resource-for-learning-powershell.aspx" target="_blank">Study Guide</a> for the 2012 games, but over at PowerShell Down Under we thought we’d give you a bit of an extra hand. For that reason, I’ve put together a series of videos which will be released throughout this month to get you a bit of a head start on each of the topics. The first video, <a href="http://powershelldownunder.com/2012/03/13/scripting-games-2012-working-with-computer-hardware/" target="_blank">Working With Computer Hardware</a>, was released yesterday. 
This is my first set of videos (I refuse to use the word ‘w**inar’ ever) so I would really appreciate any feedback you are willing to provide. Feel free to be anonymous if you wish to leave scathing reviews!
Seriously though, I hope you find something valuable in the video series, and best of luck in The Games!
