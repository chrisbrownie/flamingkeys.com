<p>So at long last, it looks like my dream of a PowerShell user group in Melbourne is about to take off! In collaboration with Shane Hoey (<a href="https://twitter.com/shanehoey" target="_blank">@shanehoey</a>) and Adam Bell (<a href="https://twitter.com/leadfollowmove" target="_blank">@leadfollowmove</a>) we are aiming to increase the knowledge and use of PowerShell in this great southern land. Shane and Adam run successful PowerShell user groups in Brisbane and Perth, respectively. My hope is that these three groups will help Systems Administrators (and other IT people) around Australia and the world to be more productive and less repetitive. PowerShell is a fantastic technology, and in my opinion, if you’re a Windows administrator but don’t know PowerShell you may soon be in trouble!</p>
