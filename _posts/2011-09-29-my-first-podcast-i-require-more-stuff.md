This week I was privileged to speak with [Mick Huxley](https://twitter.com/thehuxman) on the Coalface Tech podcast. 

We talked on all things [TechEd](http://australia.msteched.com/), [Build](http://www.buildwindows.com/), [Windows 8](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2011/09/13/welcome-to-windows-8-the-developer-preview.aspx), [PowerShell v3.0](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/powershell/archive/2011/09/20/windows-management-framework-3-0-community-technology-preview-ctp-1-available-for-download.aspx) and [Infrastructure Saturday](http://www.infrastructuresaturday.org/). 

If you’re interested in hearing my rantings with Hux, check it out over [here](http://www.autechheads.com/webcasts/coalface-tech-podcast/listen/videoid/129/coalface-tech-episode-21-i-require-more-stuff) at [AuTechHeads](http://www.autechheads.com/). This was my first podcast ever so excuse the nerves and lack of preparation. I had a great time though, so hopefully some time in future I can jump back on with the guys and talk more about PowerShell and other cool tech.
