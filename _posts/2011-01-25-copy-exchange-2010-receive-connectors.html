<p>In deploying a second Exchange 2010 server I found myself needing to duplicate a receive connector with about 20 different IP entries. Being lazy (or as Terence called it; efficient), I started googling and found <a href="http://terenceluk.blogspot.com/2010/11/how-do-i-exportimport-exchange-20072010.html" target="_blank">this post</a> by Terence Luk. His procedure works, but I figured there had to be a faster way. After a few minutes of fiddling I managed to compress his technique into this one-liner:</p>
<p>[ps]New-ReceiveConnector &quot;Mail from Printers&quot; -Server EX02 -Bindings 0.0.0.0:25 -RemoteIPRanges ( Get-ReceiveConnector &quot;EX01\Mail from Printers&quot; ).RemoteIPRanges[/ps]</p>
<p>This one does the same as <a href="http://terenceluk.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Terence's</a> process, but without the intervention in the middle. I hope this helps aspiring lazy admins like me.</p>
