[Paul Cunningham](http://twitter.com/exchservpro) over at [ExchangeServerPro.com](http://ExchangeServerPro.com) has compiled a nice [list of Exchange Server 2010 session videos](http://exchangeserverpro.com/teched-north-america-2012-exchange-2010) that have come out of [TechEd North America](http://northamerica.msteched.com/) this year. If you have any more than a passing interest in Exchange Server, Iâ€™d suggest you head over to his site and check out the videos. Be sure to subscribe to his newsletter for some seriously great Exchange Server content.

[Mick Huxley](http://twitter.com/thehuxman) and I interviewed Paul on the [CoalfaceTech](http://www.coalfacetech.com) Podcast last month, and the first part is already online.
