# About me

My name is Chris Brown. I work as a systems engineer in Melbourne, Australia, dealing with Office 365 and Microsoft/Amazon's public cloud products. My long-standing passion is the automation of everything. In my spare time, I like to write code and fly planes.

I've been in IT for almost 10 years, and in that time have worked primarily with Microsoft Windows, focussing on Active Directory and Exchange Server. The last few years have seen my focus shift [to the cloud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jR6xbulUmsg&t=6s).

In my spare time, I fly little planes around the Melbourne area. My current goals are to achieve my aerobatics and formation endorsements.

## Things I'm playing with

There's always something interesting happening. Here's what I'm playing with at the moment:

### [CarTracker](https://github.com/chrisbrownie/cartracker)

This is a project I'm working on to meet my requirements for  the Australian Tax Office's car...stuff. I need to record my odometer reading and distance travelled on all work trips. Being as lazy as I am, I'm putting together a little technical solution to save me 5 seconds at the start and end of each trip. Basically it's a GPS + Raspberry Pi + 4G Modem + AWS coolness combo.
