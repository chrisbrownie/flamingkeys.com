My name is Chris Brown. I work as a systems engineer in Melbourne, Australia, dealing with Office 365 and Microsoft/Amazon's public cloud products. My long-standing passion is the automation of everything. In my spare time, I like to write code and fly planes.

I've been in IT for somewhere around 10 years, and in that time have worked primarily with Microsoft Windows, focussing on Active Directory and Exchange Server. The last few years have seen my focus shift [to the cloud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jR6xbulUmsg&t=6s).

In my spare time, I fly little planes around the Melbourne area. My current goals are to achieve my aerobatics and tailwheel endorsements, as well as my commercial pilot's licence.
