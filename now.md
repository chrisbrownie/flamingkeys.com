I'm always busy with something or other. Here's what I'm currently looking at:

## [CarTracker](https://github.com/chrisbrownie/cartracker)

This is a project I'm working on to meet my requirements for  the Australian Tax Office's car...stuff. I need to record my odometer reading and distance travelled on all work trips. Being as lazy as I am, I'm putting together a little technical solution to save me 5 seconds at the start and end of each trip. Basically it's a GPS + Raspberry Pi + 4G Modem + AWS coolness combo.

## [FlamingKeys.com](https://github.com/chrisbrownie/flamingkeys.com)

I have an ongoing project to move this blog from its old WordPress installation across to a new shiny Github Pages-hosted Jekyll _thing_.
